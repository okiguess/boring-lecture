Boring Lecture
Create a new project called boring-lecture.html that is a fake page about a boring subject of your choice. Use lorem ipsum text to fill up the page using <p> tags.
Create a section of the page at the beginning for an introduction to the lecture; in that intro, include a <h2> subheading, a paragraph or two, and a picture. Give each of these elements the class intro.
Create CSS rules for h2.intro, p.intro, and img.intro. Remember that in CSS, classes are prefaced with a .

      <h2>You won't remember a thing</h2>
      <p>How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? M: I'll never forget your wedding. You're losing blood, aren't you? Gob: Probably, my socks are wet. The Army had half a day. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. I'M A MONSTER!! The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. Gob: You didn't eat that, did you? I believe you will find the dessert to be both engrossing and high-grossing! So we don't get dessert?</p>
      <p>This was a big get for God. I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪ I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper. Touché, Pandora. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. I'm not a prostitute. Michael: Then I shall let you live!</p>
